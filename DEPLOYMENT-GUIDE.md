# AlphaAI StockX - Complete Deployment Guide

## 🚀 Deploy to GitHub, Railway, and Netlify

Your AlphaAI StockX application is ready for deployment! Follow these steps to deploy to all three platforms.

## Prerequisites

Before deploying, ensure you have:
- ✅ GitHub account and repository created
- ✅ Railway account (https://railway.app)
- ✅ Netlify account (https://netlify.com)
- ✅ Node.js 18+ installed
- ✅ Git installed

## 📁 Project Structure

Your project includes all necessary configuration files:
- `railway.toml` - Railway deployment configuration
- `netlify.toml` - Netlify deployment configuration  
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` - GitHub Actions CI/CD
- `package.json` - Dependencies and scripts
- `next.config.mjs` - Next.js configuration
- `Dockerfile.railway` - Railway container configuration

## 🔧 Step 1: GitHub Repository Setup

### Option A: Create New Repository
1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Name: `AlphaAiStockX.com`
3. Description: "Advanced AI-powered stock trading platform with real-time analytics"
4. Make it Public (or Private if preferred)
5. Don't initialize with README (we have files already)

### Option B: Use Existing Repository
If you already have a repository, note the URL for later.

## 📤 Step 2: Push to GitHub

Open Terminal in your project directory and run:

```bash
# Navigate to project directory
cd "/Users/Josephkline/AlphaAiStockX/AlphaAiStockX.com/__tests__/components/AlphaAiStockX4"

# Initialize git (if not already done)
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Deploy AlphaAI StockX v2.0 - Production ready

- Complete Next.js 15.4.4 application with TypeScript
- Accessibility-compliant UI components (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Responsive design with mobile navigation  
- Comprehensive error handling and loading states
- Railway, Netlify, and GitHub Actions configurations
- SEO optimization and performance enhancements
- Real-time trading dashboard with portfolio management"

# Add remote origin (replace with your repository URL)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/AlphaAiStockX.com.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## 🚄 Step 3: Deploy to Railway

Railway deployment is configured with `railway.toml`.

### Install Railway CLI:
```bash
npm install -g @railway/cli
```

### Deploy:
```bash
# Login to Railway
railway login

# Initialize project (if first time)
railway init

# Deploy
railway deploy
```

### Railway Configuration Details:
- **Builder**: Nixpacks (automatic detection)
- **Health Check**: / endpoint with 5-minute timeout  
- **Auto-restart**: On failure with 10 max retries
- **Node.js**: Version 18+ with production optimizations

## 🌐 Step 4: Deploy to Netlify

Netlify deployment is configured with `netlify.toml`.

### Install Netlify CLI:
```bash
npm install -g netlify-cli
```

### Deploy:
```bash
# Login to Netlify
netlify login

# Deploy to production
netlify deploy --prod

# Or create a new site and deploy
netlify init
netlify deploy --prod
```

### Netlify Configuration Details:
- **Build Command**: `pnpm install && pnpm build`
- **Publish Directory**: `.next`
- **Node Version**: 18
- **Plugin**: @netlify/plugin-nextjs for optimal Next.js support

## 🔄 Step 5: GitHub Actions CI/CD

Your repository includes automated CI/CD that will:
- ✅ Run on every push to `main`
- ✅ Test with Node.js 18.x and 20.x
- ✅ Run type checking
- ✅ Run build verification
- ✅ Auto-deploy to Railway and Netlify

## 🔐 Environment Variables

Set these in your deployment platforms:

### Railway Environment Variables:
```
NODE_ENV=production
NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1
```

### Netlify Environment Variables:
```
NODE_ENV=production
NEXT_TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1
```

## 📊 Monitoring & Performance

After deployment, monitor:
- **Railway**: Dashboard for logs, metrics, and health
- **Netlify**: Analytics, performance, and function logs
- **GitHub**: Actions workflow status and deployment history

## 🎯 Custom Domains (Optional)

### Railway:
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to Settings > Domains
4. Add your custom domain

### Netlify:
1. Go to Netlify dashboard  
2. Select your site
3. Go to Domain settings
4. Add custom domain

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

**Build Failures:**
- Check Node.js version (18+ required)
- Verify all dependencies in package.json
- Check TypeScript errors with `npm run type-check`

**Deployment Failures:**
- Verify environment variables
- Check deployment logs
- Ensure all required files are committed

**Performance Issues:**
- Review Next.js build output
- Check bundle size with `npm run build`
- Optimize images and assets

## 📝 Deploy Commands Summary

```bash
# Quick deploy to all platforms
npm run build                    # Verify build works
git add . && git commit -m "Deploy"  # Commit changes
git push origin main            # Push to GitHub
railway deploy                  # Deploy to Railway  
netlify deploy --prod          # Deploy to Netlify
```

## 🎉 Success!

- **GitHub**: https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/AlphaAiStockX.com
- **Railway**: https://YOUR_APP.railway.app  
- **Netlify**: https://YOUR_APP.netlify.app

The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically deploy updates when you push to the main branch.

## 🔗 Live URLs

After deployment, update these in your project:
- Production URL in `package.json`
- Social media links
- Documentation links
- API endpoints (if applicable)
